                    <p>Technology represents the driving force of positive developments in our progressing contemporary
                        world, which modify various spheres of human life. The effect of internet communication is that
                        it breaks barriers and brings people closer irrespective of the distances separating them.
                        People’s ability to communicate with others located far away from them like friends, family
                        members or even colleagues has become a reality due to the availability of smartphone devices
                        social media networks and communication applications. It is the enhanced connectivity that
                        enriches interpersonal relations even more but, above all enhances international cooperation to
                        make us feel unity and understanding as we need them now.</p>

                    <p>
                        Certainly, the more technology is absorbed into our regular lives so are its challenges and
                        negative facets. The prevalence of smart phone devices and constant communication bring with
                        them the threat of information overload; digital addiction and social withdrawal set in. Other
                        issues that are associated with automation, job elimination and privacy become obvious due to
                        the high speed of technological innovations. Moreover, environmental hazards emanating from the
                        manufacture and dumping of electronics pose a grave risk to our planet. During the digital age,
                        it is necessary to point out these negative phenomena and try in some way to soften them so that
                        they do not have too much impact on our lives.</p>

                    <span style="color: #d905d9;"> Impact of technology on daily life and printing business</span>
                    <p>The effects of technology in our daily living and the printing business are indeed great,
                        revolutionizing people’s lifestyle while transforming age-old industries. Technology has brought
                        unmatched forms of convenience and efficiency in our day to day lives. Smartphones and digital
                        devices are essential as they simplify communication, grant immediate information
                        accessibility,and thus allow different tasks to be performed at our fingertips. On the other
                        hand, this move has also changed printing industry. Digital printing technology has moved in to
                        change the landscape of the industry with faster production time, cost effective solutions and
                        print jobs customization capabilities. Although this has improved productivity and decreased
                        wastes, it has also presented problems to conventional print practices that should do adjustment
                        and innovation for them to survive in the new digital era.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>To sum up, the two-way effect of technology on human activities and printing industry reveals
                compatibility between convenience and challenges. As technology becomes a part of our lifestyles, it
                improves on communication, connectivity and accessibility culminating in better efficiency with life
                being more interconnected. Nevertheless, the transformation is not without flaws as issues such as
                digital addiction, concerns around privacy and environmental impacts emerge. In the same way, digital
                developments come with their benefits as well challenges for printing industry which is trying to find a
                balance between antiquity and demands of today’s dynamic environment. There is a need to be able to find
                the balance between being welcoming of all that’s positive about technology and addressing its negative
                influences as we strive forward along with this changing age of innovation.
